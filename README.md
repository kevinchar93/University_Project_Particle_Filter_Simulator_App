# Particle Filter Simulator (Final Year Project)
This repo is one of a number from my final year project at university. This in particular is for a piece of software used to simulate two dimensional Monte Carlo localisation. More specific details about the project and the Particle Filter Simulator in particular can be found below.

### About the Project
My final year project at university was inspired somewhat by my placement year where I worked on programming embedded systems in the form of TV set top boxes, having had this experience I decided to work on a project that dealt with some form of embedded system. In the end I decided to construct and program a robot capable of localising itself in two dimensions.

By the end of the project I'd encountered issues that made me scale down the project. Ultimately I produced a robot that is capable of localising itself in only one dimension, however another piece of software which presents a simple simulation of two dimensional localisation was implemented instead.

The project report titled "**An Implementation of a Mobile Robot with Localisation Capabilities**" can be found in the root directory of this repo.

In total for the project 4 deliverables were created (links to repos in brackets):
* The actual physical robot
* The software on the robot's embedded platform ([Mobile Platform SW](https://github.com/kevinchar93/University_Project_Mobile_Platform_SW))
* Software used to control the robot remotely & estimate its position ([Grid Localisation App](https://github.com/kevinchar93/University_Project_Grid_Loclisation_App))
* A two dimensional Monte Carlo localisation simulator  ([Particle Filter Simulator App](https://github.com/kevinchar93/University_Project_Particle_Filter_Simulator_App))
